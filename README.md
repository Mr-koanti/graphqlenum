# graphqlenum
##What this tool?
This project provides a Python tool for generating URL-encoded GraphQL queries and mutations directly from a GraphQL API endpoint. It utilizes the introspection capabilities of GraphQL APIs to fetch the schema details, then constructs and outputs URLs that represent valid queries and mutations. These URLs can be directly accessed in a browser or HTTP client, facilitating easy testing and exploration of the API.
#Usage :
Run the Script: Use the command line to run the script, providing the URL of your GraphQL API. For example:

``python graphql.py -u https://your-graphql-api.com/graphql``
